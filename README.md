grouped by categories.  
You can use them for any puropose you like.

If you want to run any of the files, you can just compile them them and run  
them like any other source code file, except for the java files. You need to   
rename the file to "Main.java" to be able to compile it. because the main class  
for the all these java files is "Main". The files are named as the number of the problem just  
for reference purpose.
